# Yalla Goal demo

## State Management Pattern: Provider

## Project Architecture : MVC

### Models:
I create two models: game model and user model, user model is not used in the code yet but I implemented it in order to add authentication later

### Views:
there are two pages in the app: home page and form page, I implemented the sub widgets inside their related classes

### Controllers:
using change notifier provider classes I created two controllers:
user provider: in order to add authentication later
games provider: to control games features: add, delete, update...etc

### Translations Folder:
contains json key-values for localization
